ivars, synthz... whats needed?
image types (from project file?)
paths, add smart ones?
double loadImages?
class name collisions
try rebase history
NSImage, OSXify
S for strings, lproj, keys? PBXVariantGroup and via file refs
user xcode setting RGEN variable? shared project file
xcode error/warning file:line: warning|error: blabla
skip init for leaf classes
fake suffix stripped path for paths
custome source tress (~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Xcode.plist)

RGEN=/Users/mattias/src/rgen/build/Debug/rgen
if which $RGEN > /dev/null; then
  $RGEN $PROJECT_FILE_PATH $SRCROOT/Classes/Resources
fi

DONE verbose log, vert verbose log?
NOPE Paths P (stinrg or url?)
DONE P optional?
DONE refactor Paths code, smart generated code
DONE @ipad image load method
DONE target nil, error?
DONE generate less code : ? and stuff?
DONE exit with error on conflicts?
DONE rgen .. ... || true
DONE recursive loadImages
DONE output filename
DONE sorted output, makes diffs nicer
NOPE preLoadImages (via path?)
NOPE $(SRCROOT)/Classes/Resources.h/m $(PROJECT_FILE_PATH) (does not work with updated folders)
NOPE depend on projectfile mtime?
DONE generate h/m per target (argument?)
DONE var starts with char
DONE generated from, relative path (so its not changed against scm)
DONE comment outputcode (path refrences etc)
DONE sanetize/normalize variable names
DONE move recurse etc to own class
DONE move prune to own class too
DONE error checks
NOPE run script varaibles.. target? one run script per target anyway
